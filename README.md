# BankingApplication

The Bank Application Project consists of two major modules. In the first module, users can perform the following actions:

Create Account: Users can create their bank account by providing necessary details such as name, account number, and initial deposit amount.
Login: Registered users can log in to their accounts using their credentials (account number and password).
Exit Application: Users can choose to exit the application at any time.
Once logged in, the application presents the following services to the user:

Check Balance: Users can check the balance of their account, showing them their current funds.
Deposit: Users can make deposits to their account by specifying the amount they wish to add.
Withdraw: Users can withdraw money from their account by entering the amount they want to take out.
Return to Home Page: Users have the option to go back to the main page to access other services.
To ensure security, the application implements a lockout mechanism that restricts login after three consecutive wrong password attempts. Every user must create an account before accessing the application, ensuring a valid account is necessary for using the banking services. This project provides a basic yet functional banking system with essential features and a focus on user security and convenience.
